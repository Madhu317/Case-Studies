Since each shop might have different sales we are going to create a model for each shop


We need to summarize item count for month for training our model to predict monthly item sale count:

Group by timeBlock and itemID so that we get our new response variable (item_count_month)


we would get something like below data set:

for shop1...... Shop 60

timeblock,itemid,item_count_month

0,112,5

0,113,4

0,114,1

1,112,5

2,112,2


Initially we are going to pick the following variables for our model

x--> time block (independent)

y--> item id (independent)

z--> item_count_month (dependent)



After training, we will have s1 to s60 model respectively for shop 1 to 60


then we will iterate the test dataset on each model and append the result to a file which will be our final out put file
